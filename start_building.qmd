# Chapter 3: 🧱 Planning Your House and Moving It to the Land

Now that your workshop is set up and all your tools are installed, it is time to **plan the first version of your house** (your Quarto Book) and prepare the **land** (GitHub) where it will stand.

In this chapter, we will:

- look at the important parts of your workshop,
- get a **delivery truck** to move your house to the land,
- buy our **piece of land** on GitHub,
- and hire a **construction worker** to rebuild your house whenever you update your blueprint.

Let’s begin!

## 🧰 What You Will Find in Your Workshop (RStudio)

When you create a Quarto Book project in your workshop, you will see two very important things:

- 📐 **The `_quarto.yml` file**  
  This is your **blueprint**.  
  It describes how your house should be built and how the rooms (chapters) should be arranged.

- 🚪 **`.qmd` files**  
  These are the **rooms of your house** — each `.qmd` file is one chapter or section of your book.

You will write your content inside these `.qmd` files, and adjust the blueprint in `_quarto.yml` as your house grows.

## 🚚 Buy the Delivery Truck (Install GitHub Desktop)

To get your blueprints and building materials **from your workshop to the land**, you need a **delivery truck**.

This truck is called **GitHub Desktop**.

It transports your updated files from RStudio (your workshop) to GitHub (your land).

➡️ Download GitHub Desktop here:  
https://desktop.github.com/

Install it like a regular Windows program (Next → Next → Finish).

Once installed, your delivery truck is ready to use.

## 🌍 Buy the Land (Create Your GitHub Account)

Before you can place your house anywhere, you need to **own a piece of land**.

If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, create one:

➡️ https://github.com/

This account is your personal land registry — your plots of land (projects) will be stored here.

---

## 🏡 Prepare a Plot of Land for Your House (Create a Repository)

A **repository** is like a **plot of land** where your house (your book project) will be built.

Once logged into GitHub:

1. Click **“+” → “New repository”**
2. Give your land a name (e.g., `my-quarto-book`)
3. Choose **Public** (so visitors can see your house)  
4. Click **Create repository**

Your land now exists!

---

## 🚚 Move Your House Materials to the Land (Commit & Push)

Your workshop and your land are separate places.  
The **delivery truck (GitHub Desktop)** moves your house files from the workshop → to your land.

Whenever you change your blueprint or add new rooms:

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Write a short summary of what changed  
   Example: “Added Chapter 2”
3. Click **Commit to main**
4. Click **Push origin**  
   (This sends the materials to the land)

Only then can the construction worker start rebuilding the house.

---

## 👷 Hire the Construction Worker on the Land (Add publish.yml)

The last step is to hire a **construction worker** that lives on your land.

This worker automatically rebuilds your house whenever new materials arrive by truck.

This worker is a small file called:
.github/workflows/publish.yml



You will add this file on GitHub once your land and workshop are connected.

This construction worker:

- watches for new deliveries,
- rebuilds your house,
- and updates the public version of your house for visitors to see.

---

Once your land is ready, your truck is connected, and your construction worker is hired, you will be able to **publish your house online** so anyone can visit it on the public street (GitHub Pages).

In the next chapter, we will **build your first Quarto House in the workshop** and send it to the land for the first time!
