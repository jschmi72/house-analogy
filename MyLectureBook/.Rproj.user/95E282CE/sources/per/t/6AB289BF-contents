# Chapter 2: 🧰 Setting Up Your Workshop

Before you can start building your Quarto house, you need to set up your **workshop** — the place where you will write your book, prepare your materials, and update your blueprint.

Just like a real house needs tools, we need a few digital tools too.  
Here’s what we will install:

- 🧱 **R** – the hardware store that provides building materials and supports Quarto (not always required, but recommended)
- 🧰 **RStudio** – your workshop where you write your chapters and edit the blueprint
- 🏗️ **Quarto** – the civil engineer who builds your house (your book) into a website
- 🚚 **GitHub Desktop** - the delivery truck that transports new building materials and updated blue prints from your workshop to the land.

## Step 1: 🧱 Install R (the hardware store)

R provides the basic materials that Quarto can use for building your book.

➡️ Download R here:  
https://cran.r-project.org/

Choose your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and follow the installation instructions.

## Step 2: 🧰 Install RStudio (your workshop)

RStudio is where you will spend most of your time writing your chapters and managing your project.

➡️ Download RStudio here:  
https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Install it like a regular program (Next → Next → Finish).

## Step 3: 🏗️ Install Quarto (the civil engineer)

Quarto is the expert that knows how to build your book into a real website.

➡️ Download Quarto here:  
https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

After installation, you can check if it works by opening RStudio and typing this in the Console:




If everything is installed correctly, you will see a confirmation message.

Once you have installed R, RStudio, and Quarto, your **workshop is fully set up** and you’re ready to begin! 🧰✨

In the next chapter, we will **plan your house** (your Quarto book) and prepare the **land and delivery truck** so you can place it online for visitors to explore. 🌍🚚
