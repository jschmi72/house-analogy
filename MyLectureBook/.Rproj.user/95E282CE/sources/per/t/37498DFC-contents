# Preface

Welcome to **🏠 The House Analogy Guide to Quarto & GitHub**.

This guide will teach beginners how to:

-   set up Quarto
-   build a book project
-   connect it to GitHub
-   publish it online using GitHub Pages

We will use a simple **house-building analogy** to make each step clear and easy to remember.
