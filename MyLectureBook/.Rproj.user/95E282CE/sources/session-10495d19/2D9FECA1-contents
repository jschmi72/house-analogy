# Chapter 1: 🏠 The House Analogy

Before we start building our Quarto book and publishing it online, it's helpful to understand the **house analogy** that will guide us through the process.

In this analogy:

-   🧱 **R** is the *hardware store* that provides building materials.
-   🧰 **RStudio** is the *workshop* where you prepare materials, plan rooms and edit the blueprint.
-   🏗️ **Quarto** is the *civil engineer* who constructs the house (your book).
-   🌍 **GitHub** (website) is the *piece of land* where you place your house so others can visit it.
-   🚚 **GitHub** **Desktop** is the *delivery truck* that delivers materials (your updates) from the workshop to the land.
-   🚧 **GitHub Pages** is the *public street* where people can find and walk through your house online.

This analogy will help you understand each step in a friendly and visual way, even if you are completely new to Quarto or GitHub.
