    "text": "Before we start building our Quarto book and publishing it online, it’s helpful to understand the house analogy that will guide us through the process.\nIn this analogy:\n\n🧱 .qmd files are the bricks and rooms of your house (your book’s content).\n🧰 RStudio is the workshop where you prepare materials and edit the blueprint.\n🏗️ Quarto is the civil engineer who constructs the house (your book).\n🌍 GitHub is the piece of land where you place your house so others can visit it.\n🚧 GitHub Pages is the public street where people can find and walk through your house online.\n📐 The _quarto.yml file is your blueprint describing how your house should be built.\n🛠️ The publish.yml file (in .github/workflows/) is a construction worker living on your land, who rebuilds the house whenever you make changes.\n\nThis analogy will help you understand each step in a friendly and visual way, even if you are completely new to Quarto or GitHub.",
